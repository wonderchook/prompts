# Claude Code Web Prompts

A collection of canned prompts I run in [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) to broadly keep abreast of different topics and do elaborate web searches.

These prompts are designed for autonomous research and synthesis tasks — scanning arXiv, crawling the web for signals, scouting opportunities, and surfacing emerging themes in AI and technology.

## Prompts

### AI Research & Frontier Signals

- [frontier_ai-researcher.md](frontier_ai-researcher.md) — Daily arXiv scan for cutting-edge AI research (5 papers)
- [fronteir_ai_theme_researcher.md](fronteir_ai_theme_researcher.md) — Thematic synthesis of frontier AI research through a specific lens
- [theme-surfer-ai.md](theme-surfer-ai.md) — Discover emerging, non-obvious themes across frontier AI materials
- [theme-spider.md](theme-spider.md) — Web-wide signal harvesting for early AI patterns and tensions
- [improve-prompting-researcher.md](improve-prompting-researcher.md) — arXiv papers for improving LLM prompting (non-technical focus)

### Pop-Science & Web Vibes

- [pop-sci-crawler.md](pop-sci-crawler.md) — Crawl the web for AI vibes, anecdotes, and informal narratives
- [pop-sci-deep-dive.md](pop-sci-deep-dive.md) — Deep-dive investigation into a single AI topic across the web

### Broad Research

- [broad-research-scout.md](broad-research-scout.md) — Wide-spectrum literature and discourse scan (academic, policy, industry, pop, weird)
- [broad-research-scout-part-2-weird.md](broad-research-scout-part-2-weird.md) — Follow-up prompt for weirdness and frontier deep dives

### Opportunity Scouting

- [opportunity-scout.md](opportunity-scout.md) — Weekly scan for public-interest tech consulting, RFPs, fellowships, and grants
- [cto-opportunity-scout.md](cto-opportunity-scout.md) — Weekly scan for fractional CTO and senior engineering leadership opportunities
