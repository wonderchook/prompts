## Where to Search (Rotate Weekly)

Search broadly across **institutional, public-sector, multilateral, and private-sector sources**.  
Do **not** rely primarily on fractional job boards; treat them as a secondary signal.

### Multilateral & International Organizations

Focus on:
- Consulting RFPs / RFQs
- Technical assistance contracts
- Digital transformation, data, AI, or systems modernization work
- Short- to medium-term advisory engagements

### National & Subnational Governments
- Government procurement portals (US, UK, EU, Canada, AU, NZ, and selected Global South countries)
- Digital service units and modernization offices
- Innovation, data, or AI-focused government programs

Look for:
- Strategy, architecture, or modernization RFPs

## Search Strategy

- Use **institution-first search queries**, not role-first queries  
  (e.g., “World Bank digital transformation RFP”, “UNDP AI consultant”, “government platform modernization RFQ”)

- Combine leadership and systems terms with procurement language:
  - “technical advisor”, “systems architect”, “digital transformation”
  - “consulting services”, “technical assistance”, “implementation support”
  - “AI strategy”, “data platform”, “cloud modernization”

- Actively search:
  - Procurement portals
  - Multilateral organization project pages
  - PDF RFPs and appendices
  - Program and initiative microsites

- Follow links deeply and laterally:
  - From project pages to procurement notices
  - From RFPs to related programs or future phases

- Look for **signals of seniority and trust**, such as:
  - Emphasis on advisory or strategic judgment
  - Access to senior stakeholders or decision-makers
  - Responsibility for shaping direction, not just delivery

- Prefer outcomes-based language and scope descriptions over task lists

- When postings are sparse:
  - Identify active programs or initiatives
  - Flag them as candidates for proactive outreach or pre-RFP conversations
